# stm32-serial-cli
A lightweight **Command Line Interface (CLI)** framework for **STM32 microcontrollers**, written in **bare-metal C**.  
It provides a simple way to register, interpret, and execute commands through a UART serial terminal —  
helping developers interact with their embedded systems in real time.
